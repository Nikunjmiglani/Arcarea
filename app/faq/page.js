    question: "1. Why should I list my services on ArcArea when Justdial, Sulekha, and others are free?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Unlike general listing portals, ArcArea is a <em>curated, niche marketplace</em> built exclusively for:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Architects</li>
          <li>Interior designers</li>
          <li>Modular & custom furniture makers</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          We focus on <strong>quality over quantity</strong>. While free sites allow anyone to list, we work only with
          <strong> verified, serious professionals</strong>. This builds client trust and <strong>reduces spam, fake leads, and price hagglers</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic mt-3 text-gray-600">
          ArcArea delivers real, vastu-aligned, project-ready clients ‚Äî not random inquiries.

  },
  {
    question: "2. What makes ArcArea different from other service directories?",
    answer: (
      <>
        ArcArea isn‚Äôt a mass listing site. We are a <em>focused platform for design, build, and d√©cor services</em>. Our key differences include:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Vastu-based client onboarding</li>
          <li>Verified seller badges</li>
          <li>Customizable profile portfolio</li>
          <li>Contact unlocking after client intent</li>
          <li>No project commissions</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">We bridge the gap between <strong>authentic design professionals and aligned homebuyers</strong>.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "3. Why do you charge a listing fee when others don‚Äôt?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The nominal listing fee helps us:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Filter out low-quality sellers</li>
          <li>Run paid campaigns to bring genuine clients</li>
          <li>Offer platform support and visibility tools</li>
          <li>Maintain a <strong>clean, premium ecosystem</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This small investment helps you <strong>stand apart</strong> from overcrowded free platforms.
          Plus, we never charge a commission on your project value.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "4. Will my contact details be shared openly?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. To protect seller privacy and ensure serious leads, we use a <strong>contact unlock model</strong>:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Your brand name and portfolio are visible</li>
          <li>Clients must pay a small fee to unlock your contact details</li>
          <li>You receive only high-quality, serious inquiries</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic mt-3 text-gray-600">
          This eliminates time-wasters and increases conversion rates.
        </blockquote>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "5. Can I showcase my real company name and branding?",
    answer: (
      <p>

        You‚Äôre not just a listing ‚Äî you‚Äôre a <strong>brand</strong>.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "6. Do you take any commission on projects or earnings?",
    answer: <p><strong>No.</strong> ArcArea never takes a cut from your earnings. Your projects, your pricing, your profits ‚Äî 100% yours.</p>,

    answer: (
